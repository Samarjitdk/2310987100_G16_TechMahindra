              The Maratha Confederacy,[a] also referred to as the Maratha
              Empire, was an early modern polity in the Indian subcontinent. It
              comprised the realms of the Peshwa and four major independent
              Maratha states often subordinate to the former. It was established
              in 1674 with the coronation of Shivaji as the Maratha Chhatrapati
              and recognised by Emperor Bahadur Shah I as a tributary state in
              1707 following a prolonged rebellion.
